// Shared RTC-persistent state for hokku ESP32 firmwares.
//
// All state that must survive deep sleep AND esp_restart() lives here as
// RTC_NOINIT_ATTR globals, validated together exactly once per boot chain by
// hokku_state_validate(). Both huessen_epf1301 and seeedstudio_e1004 link this;
// their board-specific app_main / regime code reads and writes these globals.
//
// RTC_NOINIT_ATTR (not RTC_DATA_ATTR): initialisers are NOT respected and the
// section is not reloaded on any reset. On a true power-on the values are
// garbage — hokku_state_validate() catches that via the magic sentinel and
// zero-initialises everything exactly once. RTC_DATA_ATTR would be wrong: it is
// re-initialised on every esp_restart(), the root cause of the historical
// "boot_count always 1 / clk_now always 0" bug.
